# Sales Dashboard 2023
 This project takes a deep dive into the business' sales data to uncover patterns and trends in sales performance and extracted valuable insights and actionable information for better and strategic decison-making.
 The following insigts were exttacted from the analysis:

 - Profit Margin: 58.83%
 - Total Quantity of Goods Sold: 209,000
 - Total Revenue: $34.49M
 - December has the highest sales performance
 - Sundays are the best performing sales day
 - San Francisco is the best performing state in revenue and profit
 - The best selling products are Macbook pro laptop, iPhone, ThinkPad Laptop, Google Phone and 27 in 4k Gaming Monitor

 To increase business profit and efficiency, I recommend:

 - Sales and product availabiltiy should be optimised in San Francisco
 - Discount sales should be driven on Sundays on tHE best performing products to drive in more sales
 - End of the year promotions should be held in the month of December to drive in more sales and to retain customers in the next business year
 - Discount sales can be introduced on best performing products to increase sales and attract new customers
